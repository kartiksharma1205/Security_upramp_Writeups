# 🛡️ CloudBreach - May 2025: Risk Assessment Summary & Remediation Checklist

## 🔥 Risk Assessment Summary

### 🔓 Breach Vector
- **Public S3 Bucket Exposure**: Unauthenticated access allowed an external attacker to list and download files from `cloudbreach-s3`.

### 🔑 Credential Compromise
- **Sensitive Credentials in Plain Text**: A file (`config.txt`) containing valid IAM access keys was exposed in the public bucket.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Using those keys, the attacker assumed an `admin-role`.

### 📁 Data Exfiltration
- **Access to Restricted Data**: The attacker used elevated privileges to download `confidential.docx` from the private `finance-data` bucket.

### 🌐 Attack Footprint
- **Source IP**: All activity came from **45.67.89.123**, indicating a focused breach.
- **Attack Duration**: The entire breach—from initial access to data theft—occurred in under 15 minutes.

### 🎯 Risk Impact

| Category           | Risk Level | Description                                                             |
|--------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality**| 🚨 High    | Sensitive financial documents were exposed and exfiltrated.             |
| **Integrity**      | ⚠️ Medium  | No evidence of tampering, but attacker had full rights to do so.        |
| **Availability**   | ✅ Low     | No service disruption observed.                                         |
| **Compliance**     | 🚨 High    | Possible violations of data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).        |
| **Reputation**     | 🚨 High    | Serious reputational risk due to mishandled credentials and data theft. |

## ✅ Remediation Checklist

### 🧰 Immediate Containment
- [ ] 🔒 Revoke all IAM keys found in `config.txt`
- [ ] 🚫 Block IP `45.67.89.123` via security groups or WAF
- [ ] 🗝️ Rotate IAM credentials, especially for `admin-role`
- [ ] 🚨 Enable CloudTrail alerts for suspicious `AssumeRole` and S3 actions

### 🛠️ Root Cause Fixes
- [ ] 📦 Audit all S3 buckets for public access (`ListBucket` without auth)
- [ ] 🧾 Scan public buckets for sensitive files (e.g., `*.txt`, `*.env`, `*.pem`)
- [ ] 🔐 Apply Least Privilege Principle to IAM policies
- [ ] 🚦 Set "S3 Block Public Access" to **ON** by default across all accounts

### 🔍 Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] 📈 Enable full S3 access logging and AWS GuardDuty in all regions
- [ ] 🛎️ Create real-time alerts for:
    - Anonymous or external access to S3
    - `AssumeRole` usage from unknown IPs
    - Downloads of sensitive documents
- [ ] ⏳ Extend CloudTrail log retention to support long-term investigations

### 👥 Governance & Awareness
- [ ] 🧠 Conduct cloud security training for developers and infrastructure teams
- [ ] 🛡️ Establish a secure secret management practice (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] 🧾 Update and test the Incident Response Playbook based on this scenario
