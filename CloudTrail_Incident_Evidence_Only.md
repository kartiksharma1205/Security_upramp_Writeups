## ‚úÖ Confirmed Findings from CloudTrail Logs

### 1. No Evidence of Resource Creation or Modification
- No `RunInstances`, `CreateUser`, `CreateRole`, `PutRolePolicy`, or similar API calls were detected.
- Therefore, **no AWS infrastructure was created or changed** based on available logs.

---

### 2. Observed Events

| Time (UTC)           | Event         | Source                     | Source IP         | Identity Type | Notes                                             |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-03-04 23:59:15  | ListStacks    | cloudformation.amazonaws.com | 76.147.57.220    | AssumedRole    | User listed CloudFormation stacks (recon step)    |
| 2025-03-04 23:59:09‚Äì39 | PutObject   | s3.amazonaws.com           | cloudtrail.amazonaws.com | AWSService     | S3 writes to CloudTrail log buckets (log delivery) |

### Interpretation
- Only suspicious event is `ListStacks` from an external IP (76.147.57.220) ‚Äî likely reconnaissance.
- `PutObject` events were automated AWS CloudTrail log deliveries and **not attacker activity**.

---

### 3. No Signs of Lateral Movement or Persistence
- No AssumeRole into unknown roles
- No unauthorized S3 `GetObject` or `PutObject` events
- No activity involving IAM, EC2, Lambda, or VPC changes

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Final Conclusion Based on Evidence

- One suspicious API call observed (`ListStacks`) using an assumed Admin role.
- **No evidence** of resource creation, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms.
