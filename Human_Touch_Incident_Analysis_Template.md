# 📘 Human-Touch Incident Analysis: Reusable Prompt & Documentation Process

## 🔧 Reusable Prompt Template

> I’m sharing reference file(s) that include technical logs, summaries, or documentation.  
>   
> Please read the content carefully and give me a clear, human-readable summary that:  
> - Explains **only what is directly supported by the file(s)**  
> - Uses a **natural tone**, like explaining it to a team member or stakeholder  
> - Avoids **assumptions or guesses**—stick strictly to the evidence  
> - Highlights **what happened**, **how it happened**, and **what it proves**  
> - If relevant, include **real-world analogies** to clarify complex ideas  
> - Present the results in a **structured and easy-to-read format** (e.g., with step-by-step breakdowns, bullet points, and sections like "What Happened", "Log Evidence", "Takeaway")  

> Do **not** add extra analysis or extrapolation unless explicitly asked.  
> Be precise, clear, and thoughtful in tone.

## 📝 Documentation Process: “Human-Touch Incident Analysis”

This process ensures every file or log is turned into a useful, high-trust summary that can be shared with technical and non-technical audiences.

---

### Step 1: 🧾 Input Collection
- Collect relevant files (logs, incident markdowns, audit trails)
- Ensure the scope is limited to what’s verifiable from those files

---

### Step 2: 🧠 Set Prompting Style
Use the reusable prompt above or modify based on:
- Audience (exec, engineer, compliance)
- Tone (conversational, formal, brief, detailed)
- Objective (report, email update, presentation)

---

### Step 3: 🧩 Break Down the Content
Use this structure:
1. **Summary of the Incident**
2. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
   - What happened
   - Log Evidence
   - What it means
   - Human takeaway
3. **Final Wrap-up**
   - IP linkages, privilege escalations, breach scope, etc.

(Optional)
- Risk assessment
- Remediation checklist

---

### Step 4: 🧼 Polish for Readability
- Use ✅, 🔐, 📁, etc. for quick scanning
- Convert logs to `json` blocks
- Keep explanations short, sharp, and focused
- Use metaphors sparingly but powerfully

---

### Step 5: 🧾 Output Format Options
- Markdown file (technical docs, GitHub, Confluence)
- PDF (for sharing with external stakeholders)
- Slide deck (for briefings or executive summaries)

---

## ✅ Example Use Cases
- Post-mortem write-ups
- Breach timeline reviews
- Forensic summaries
- Security audits
- Red/blue team exercise outputs
