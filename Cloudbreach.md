**Title:** Log Analysis for Security Monitoring

### **Introduction**
Log analysis is an important part of keeping computer systems safe. It helps organizations detect, investigate, and stop potential security threats. This guide explains a simple approach to understanding logs, finding unusual activities, and improving security.

### **Steps to Analyze Logs**
#### **1. Understanding What Logs Are**
Before analyzing logs, it's important to know what they are and where they come from. Some common types of logs include:
- **Application logs** – Show what actions users take in an application.
- **Security logs** – Record login attempts and changes to security settings.
- **Network logs** – Track internet traffic and detect unusual connections.

#### **2. Setting Up Simple Tools for Log Analysis**
You can use different tools to read and filter log files efficiently:
- **jq** – Helps to search and filter logs in JSON format.
- **grep, awk, and sed** – Help find specific words or patterns in log files.
- **Basic scripts or charts** – Make it easier to see patterns in logs.

#### **3. Spotting Suspicious Activities**
Some signs that something may be wrong include:
- **Failed Logins:**
  - Many incorrect password attempts in a short time.
  - Logins from locations or devices that are unusual.
- **Changes in Permissions:**
  - If a user suddenly gets extra permissions they didn’t have before.
  - If an admin role is assigned to someone who doesn’t need it.
- **Unusual System Activity:**
  - Running rare or dangerous commands.
  - Unexpected changes to security settings.

#### **4. Connecting Events to Investigate an Incident**
- Check timestamps to see when suspicious events happened.
- Look for patterns in the logs to understand how an attack may have progressed.
- Find repeated actions that could mean an ongoing threat.

#### **5. Preventing Future Security Issues**
After identifying possible threats, take these steps to improve security:
- **Use least privilege access** – Only give users the permissions they absolutely need.
- **Turn on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Adds an extra layer of security for logins.
- **Set up alerts for suspicious activities** – Helps catch problems before they get worse.
- **Limit access to sensitive actions** – Prevents unauthorized changes to critical settings.

### **Conclusion**
By following these simple steps, anyone can start analyzing logs and spotting security issues. Regularly checking logs helps keep systems safe and prevents future cyber threats.
