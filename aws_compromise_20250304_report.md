# AWS Account 238233324971 â€“ CompromisedÂ AKID Investigation (2025â€‘03â€‘04)

## ðŸ†˜ Incident Overview

On **2025-03-04 at 22:05:27 UTC**, the billing alarm for AWS account `238233324971` was triggered due to an unexpected spike in charges. A **CloudWatch alarm** had also triggered slightly earlier at **22:02:15 UTC**, suggesting possible malicious activity. The Access Key ID (AKID) tied to a commonly used IAM user for integration testing was suspected to be **compromised** and has since been **deleted**.

---
## ðŸªœ Investigation Approach

The following investigation methodology was used:

1. **Isolate All Activity by the Compromised AKID**
2. **Identify All Resource Creation and Modification**
3. **Trace Any Lateral Movement or Privilege Escalation**
4. **Identify Persistence Mechanisms (e.g., new users, access keys, roles)**
5. **Provide Supporting Evidence for Suspicious Behavior**

## Resources Created / Modified

| Resource Type | Identifier(s) | Action to Take |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **IAM user** | `systemâ€‘adminâ€‘1741125702` | Delete user & keys |
| **IAM policy** | `CustomAdminPolicy` | Delete policy |
| **IAM role** | `lambdaâ€‘roleâ€‘1741125895` | Delete role |
| **Lambda function** | `dataâ€‘processorâ€‘1741125906` | Review code âž” delete |
| **Networking** | New VPC, subnet, security group in `usâ€‘eastâ€‘1` | Remove after forensics |
| **EC2 instances** | `iâ€‘03bd14040â€¦`, `iâ€‘0a2c7f5eâ€¦` | Snapshot & terminate |

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| Category | Value |
|----------|-------|
| SourceÂ IP | **76.147.57.220** |
| Compromised user | `testing_only` |
| Backâ€‘door users | `systemâ€‘adminâ€‘1741125702` (plus earlier `systemâ€‘adminâ€‘1741070561/2200/8596`) |
| Backâ€‘door keys | AccessKeyÂ createdÂ 22:02:49Â UTC |

## Findings
1. **Resource Creation:** Rogue IAM principal, Lambda, VPC, SG, EC2 built within four minutes.
2. **Privilege Escalation:** `testing_only` âž” `AssumeRole` âž” admin STS âž” permanent admin user.
3. **Persistence:** Durable access key, custom admin policy, independent Lambda execution role.
4. **Single Actor:** All malicious API calls originate from IPÂ 76.147.57.220.
5. **No Crossâ€‘Account Spread** detected; activity remained in accountÂ 238233324971.

---

## Recommended Remediation (Immediate)
1. **Revoke & delete** all artefacts listed above (users, keys, policies, role, Lambda, VPC, EC2).
2. **Rotate credentials** for `testing_only` and migrate integration testing to shortâ€‘lived roles with MFA.
3. **Block IPÂ 76.147.57.220** at perimeter while analyzing logs.
4. **Review S3 access logs** for `GetObject` events by the IoC IP to confirm/no data theft.
5. **Enable GuardDuty, AWS Config rules, and tighter CloudWatch anomaly alarms** for IAM/network changes.
6. **Postâ€‘incident hardening:** enforce leastâ€‘privilege, remove longâ€‘lived keys, and set lowerâ€‘threshold cost alerts.
